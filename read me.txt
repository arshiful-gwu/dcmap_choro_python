i created a dummy csv file with neightborhood clusters in one column and income data in another 
income data i generated in excel using random(1 to 100)

went to open data dc and downloaded the geojson file of washington dc

i added few more clusters in the csv file itself (cluster 40 to 46) because the 
geojson file had these clusters and this had to be done to align the data with
map data

imported the data.csv file
imported the json file

imported some required libraries

initialised the folium choropleth map as dcmap

added all the required arguments/ parameters required to rneder the map

added layer control (whag this does is it takes the minimum and maximum income
chops it into some intervals according to the the fill color palete bin)

saved the map in an html file
